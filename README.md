# IPventur-Pro-1.2
famous little IPventur.sh tool, now with menu to choice nmap parameters, asking for the scan network and the output file includes scanned network and scanned date

1. download script file IPventur-eng-pro.sh (english version) or IPventur-ger-pro.sh (german version)
2. chmod +x IPventur-eng-pro.sh (or chmod +x IPventur-ger-pro.sh)
3. start script with ./IPventur-eng-pro.sh or when you would like to get the MAC addresses:
   sudo ./IPventur-eng-pro.sh
4. the script is asking for the scanning network now   
5. check output file: lanlist-10.0.1.0-08062020.txt  (date format is day month year) and formated file like lanlist-oG-10.0.1.0-08062020.txt

Feel free to change the nmap parameters, for your needs, in the script!

Happy collecting.
