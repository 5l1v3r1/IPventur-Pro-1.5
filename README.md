# IPventur-Pro-1.0
famous little IPventur.sh tool, now with menu to choice nmap parameters and the output file includes scanned network and scanned date

1. download script file IPventur-eng-pro.sh (english version) or IPventur-ger-pro.sh (german version)
2. chmod +x IPventur-eng-pro.sh (or chmod +x IPventur-ger-pro.sh)
3. start script with ./IPventur-eng-pro.sh or when you would like to get the MAC addresses:
   sudo ./IPventur-eng-pro.sh
4. the script is asking for the scanning network now   
5. check output file: lanlist-10.0.1.0-08062020.txt  (date format is day month year)

Feel free to change the nmap parameters, for your needs, in the script!

Happy collecting.
